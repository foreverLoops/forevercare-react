## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **Yarn**
- A **MongoDB** or **Supabase** account (for database and authentication management)

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forevercare-react.git

cd forevercare-react
```

### Install Dependencies

To install all the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### Environment Configuration

Create a .env file in the root of the project (if not already created) and configure any necessary environment variables, such as API keys or database URLs.

For example:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.your-backend.com
REACT_APP_AUTH_KEY=your-auth-key
```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will run the application locally on <http://localhost:3000>.

### Running Tests

To run the tests for your React components, use:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute the tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Build for Production

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the build folder. You can deploy this build to a server or hosting platform.
